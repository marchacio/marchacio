# Marchacio

Hello everyone, my name is Marco Zoratti, I'm a developer from Genoa (Italy).

### Experience and studies ðŸ“š

I'm currently studying Computer Science at UNIGE.

I have studied and used a lot of programming languages â€‹â€‹including C, C++, C#, Java, Python, Bash and more...

Surely the framework that amazed me the most is **Flutter**, with which I have been working professionally on a daily basis since 2020.
I have created a lot of apps and software for PC that I use every day for personal convenience.

_Some of them have been published on the Play Store or Apple Store :)_


### Future ðŸš€

I'm a big fan of optimization and computer security, areas that I want to delve deeper into in the future!
